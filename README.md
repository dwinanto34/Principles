  # Software Development Principles Code Showcase

This repository serves as a comprehensive demonstration of key software development principles. Each section corresponds to a specific development aspect, providing links to individual commits that showcase the implementation details.

## SOLID Principles

1. [Single Responsibility Principle](https://github.com/dwinanto34/Principles/commit/9e7fc2b9ddbac51a542e6c01893a0703844984a9)
2. [Open Closed Principle](https://github.com/dwinanto34/Principles/commit/1091c4b46d5ff59067274a96ef8df52d51fe9210)
3. [Liskov Substitution Principle](https://github.com/dwinanto34/Principles/commit/daffd453259864e0ff81d47baa218faffefff30e)
4. [Interface Segregation Principle](https://github.com/dwinanto34/Principles/commit/f1e5372d138c061da7a9f83372828e7dcca533ef)
5. [Dependency Inversion Principle](https://github.com/dwinanto34/Principles/commit/33d110995f5d9590b9f0a32f8138e126f012f61c)

## Low Coupling High Cohesion

### [Bad Practice Example](https://github.com/dwinanto34/Principles/commit/ca33eb23a225be5daaa7094e1ecd853d9a358c3e)
Example illustrating bad practice with explanations.

### **Good Practice Example**
The following examples showcase how cart, inventory, payment, promotion, and order services should be implemented using good practices. The design emphasizes the principles of low coupling and high cohesion, resulting in more modular, maintainable, and scalable software components. By adhering to these principles, the code becomes more resilient to changes, fostering a flexible and extensible architecture.
