        // It should have only one responsibility or job within a class.

        // 2. Open closed principle
        // Open for extension, but closed for modification.
        // The idea is to create a system that can be easily extended to add new object type without modifying existing code.

        // 3. Liskov substitution principle
        // Subtypes must be substitutable for their base type without altering the correctness of the program.
        // Child class should be able to do all the things that his parents could do.
